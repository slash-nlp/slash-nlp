# Lemmatization

A text pre-processing technique that converts a word to it's root(**base**) form.

Words can have many complex forms. In the English language, due to it's brilliantly sophisticated grammar, a word can be transformed with various prefixes and suffixes for appropriate use regarding the context, time, and subject.

Lemmatization helps narrow down the vocabulary by deconstructing words to their simplest or root form.

For example, the words `walking` and `walked` can be lemmatized to `walk`.

## Stop words

These are words that occur frequently in a setence but do not contribute much to the total meaning of a sentence .

## Importance

### Lemmas

A plain language can contain lots of words that are noisy unless they are properly `cleaned`. Lemmatization performs that. By removing a word's complex form into one easily-recognizable form, the word can convey proper meaning for the computer under many contexts.

### Stopwords

By removing stopwords, it is possible to structure the corpus so that focus falls on the words that are truly important.

### Note

_However, lemmatizing and dropping stopwords might result in your models performing worse. So you should treat this preprocessing as part of your hyperparameter optimization process._
